## textparser

Frequently I have to parse text into `float`, `int` and `date`, for just a few examples.
I've written that class to isolate the parsing task, instead of getting it spreaded all over the code.
This is a fairly simple class which helped me very much.

I copied the idea of using a regular expression in `__doc__` from [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).
